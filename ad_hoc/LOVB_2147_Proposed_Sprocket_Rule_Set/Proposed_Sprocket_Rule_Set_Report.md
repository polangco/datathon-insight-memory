   - **Camp Duration**: Maintained at 3 months (90 days)
   - Program type-specific validation with refined thresholds

3. **Timing Validation Rules** (Updated Parameters):
   - **Past Registration Window**: Extended from 3 to 4 months in the past
   - Registration timing relative to program dates
   - Flexible timing windows for different program types

4. **Accounting Code Rules** (Unchanged):
   - Accounting class presence validation
   - Program-specific code requirements:
     - Lessons: Account 41001, Department 106
     - Court Rental: Account 42005, Department 106
     - Boys Programs: Department 103

5. **Program Naming Rules** (Unchanged):
   - Program and package name presence validation
   - Required field completeness checks

### Performance Benchmarking Results

Based on January 2025 data (10,443 registrations):

- **Duration Validation**: 482 failures (217 too long, 265 tryout issues)
- **Timing Validation**: 17 failures (too far in past)
- **Accounting Validation**: 100% pass rate
- **Code Validation**: 37 failures (31 boys registration, 6 lessons)
- **Naming Validation**: 100% pass rate
